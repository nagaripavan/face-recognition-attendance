# Face Recognition Attendance System

Welcome to the repository for **Face Recognition Attendance System**!

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents an intelligent attendance management system powered by advanced face recognition and machine learning algorithms. Leveraging techniques such as KNN, CNN, and OpenCV, it automates attendance marking by identifying users through real-time video streams. With a Flask-based web interface and modern frontend technologies, it delivers a secure, accurate, and user-friendly solution for organizations and institutions.
